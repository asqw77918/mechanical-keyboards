## Instructions

* Print pictures
* Cut pictures out
* Attach picture to front of cap using heat tape
* Turn on heating element and let it heat up
* Place small silicone on heating element, silicone should be cut so that it touches as much of the cap surface as possible.
* Place cap on the silicone and press down on the wood arm for 30-50 seconds.
* Remove one side of the tape and check image, if it's not done you can put the tape back carfully and heat it again.
* Remember to turn off your heating element! 
* Done!

### Other Tips & Notes

* I use a size of 1.1cm x 1.1cm for the pictures I put on caps. 
	* Cherry Profile keycaps can be a little taller but this works for DSA and SA. 

* Remember to print them mirrored.

* I still have a bunch of paper and ink so if there is interest I can provide a printing service, you would send me the pictures in the right size and I would print them for a small fee and ship them to you. Shipping should be pretty cheap worldwide. Contact me via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/busgamer7394).
